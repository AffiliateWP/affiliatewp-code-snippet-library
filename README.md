AffiliateWP Code Snippet Library
========================

This is a community-maintained repository of code snippets that help modify the default behavior of [AffiliateWP](https://affiliatewp.com).

Snippets are organized into categories (folders) and each snippet is placed in its own file with a name that describes what it does.



## Submitting Your Snippet

We welcome and encourage everyone to submit their code snippets. If you would like to submit your snippet, please [fork](https://github.com/affiliatewp/library/fork) the repository and then create a [pull request](https://github.com/affiliatewp/library/compare/).

Please refer to the [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/affiliatewp/library/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting your pull request.

## Using Snippets

1. Click on the filename of the snippet you'd like to use.
2. Click the "Raw" button (next to "Blame" and "History") at the top right.
3. Save the page to your wp-content/plugins folder and upload to your server. Alternatively you can compress the file as a .zip file and upload as a plugin from within WordPress. 
4. Activate the plugin from the WordPress plugins page.
