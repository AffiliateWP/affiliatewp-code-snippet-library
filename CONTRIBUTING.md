#Contribute To AffiliateWP Code Snippet Library

The AffiliateWP code snippet library is a community-maintained repository and so contributions are always welcome.

## Submitting a Snippet

To submit a code library for inclusion in the library, please fork the repository and then submit a [pull request](http://pippinsplugins.com/submitting-your-first-pull-request/).

Guidelines for submission:

- Each snippet should be placed in its own file.
- Each snippet should have the correct [file headers](http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin#File_Headers) so it can be installed as a plugin 
- Each file should be named appropriately based on the purpose of the snippet.
- Files should be placed in the appropriate category (folder). If no category exists, you may create one with your pull request.
- All functions and classes should be prefixed with your own unique prefix, preferrably one that contains your initials followed by `_affwp_`. For example: `pw_affwp_{function name here}`.
